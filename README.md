# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard is an old company that is having a wave of employees who will reach their retirement qualifications in the near future. The company is beginning to consider how man and which positions need to be filled. There are two desired outcomes in this analysis, the first is to determine the number of employees that will be retiring based on their most recent job title. The second table to create will include the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program if in a position for a certain period of time. 

## Results 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
